With the increasing availability of large amounts of data in practically all application areas, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been attracting increasing attention for some time now. The new paradigm of data-driven AI, i.e. learning (domain) models and keeping them up-todate by using data mining techniques, is highly attractive because it reduces the effort of creating application systems. However, it also has many disadvantages. For example, models generated from data usually cannot be inspected and understood by a human being, and it is difficult to integrate already existing domain knowledge into learned models – prior or after learning.

The approaches to conceptual modelling as well as earlier approaches to AI have mainly been focusing on the manual engineering of models, which requires a great deal of time and money. Thus, depending on the application domain, these approaches scale up poorly. There is a huge potential in combining manual model engineering with data-driven model generation: the advantages of both approaches can be combined and their disadvantages be mitigated. 

In this workshop, we are interested in all kinds of submissions at the intersection of the fields of conceptual modeling and AI. More specifically, we would like to see contributions that explore the value conceptual modeling brings to AI, and, vice versa, the value that AI can bring to conceptual modeling. Papers can be in one of the following categories:

**1. Novel ideas and solutions**

**2. Critical reviews of problems and possible approaches**

**3. Agenda setting papers**

# Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Combining learned and manually engineered models

- Trade-off between explainability and model performance
- Trade-off between comprehensibility of an explanation and its completeness
- Reasoning in learned models
- Data-driven modelling support
